# RateIt-QT-Application-with-OOP-C-
Rate IT is an app that works like a review system for COLLEGES TEACHERS and HOSTELS and anyone can see the reviews later. It runs locally on a computer just for to understand the concepts of OOP in C++. Although its missing a lot of concepts but still good for beginners to dive in.


Its quite basic
I have made 4 classes
1. MAIN
2. HOSTELS
3. UNIVERSITIES
4. TEACHERS

i have used OOP concepts along with Composition
File handling is done to store the info entered in the TextFields.
