Rate IT is an app that works like a review system for COLLEGES TEACHERS and HOSTELS and anyone can see the reviews later. It runs locally on a computer just for to understand the concepts of OOP in C++. Although its missing a lot of concepts but still good for beginners to dive in.

3. UNIVERSITIES
4. TEACHERS
